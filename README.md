### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
*General Kenobi*

I'm a high school student involved with [First Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) with team [5024 Raider Robotics](https://github.com/frc5024), for now I've helped the team program 3 award-winning robots from our 2020 season [Darth Raider](https://github.com/frc5024/InfiniteRecharge) and the 2022 season [Guillotine](https://github.com/frc5024/RapidReact). And in my final year I helped team 5024 program [Juice Box](https://github.com/frc5024/Charged-Up), Juice Box is the robot that brought 5024 back into the World Championship. 

I'm attending McMaster University in the fall for my first year in the Automotive and Vehicle Engineering (BTech) program. And will be mentoring FRC Team 4039 [MakeShift Robotics](https://4039.ca/). I'm very excited to be part of this team this upcoming year. 

And in the start of 2021 I participated in a 24 hour [STEAMATHON](https://www.firstroboticscanada.org/stemathon/) with First Robotics Canada. My Team and I *(Team 20)* managed with a lot of teamwork and thinking, to win the *"Best Product Award"* after designing a [product](https://catarinaburghi.xyz/blog/2021/03/31/stemathon) to help people from all ages with disabilities to go swimming safely!
