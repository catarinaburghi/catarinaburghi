### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
*General Kenobi*

I'm a high school student involved with [First Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) with team [5024 Raider Robotics](https://github.com/frc5024), for now I've helped the team program 1 award-winning robot from our 2020 season [Darth Raider](https://github.com/frc5024/InfiniteRecharge). 

I usually won't be working on many big projects at once *as that might get difficult very fast*. But here on my github you'll find small projects like my [password generator](https://github.com/catarinaburghi/Password-Generator) or [all my homework from my grade 11 computer science class](https://github.com/catarinaburghi/ICS3U) in school.

Some bigger projects I have are my [wonderful website](https://catarinaburghi.xyz/), and in the start of 2021 I participated in a 24 hour [STEAMATHON](https://www.firstroboticscanada.org/stemathon/) with First Robotics Canada. My Team and I *(Team 20)* managed with a lot of teamwork and thinking, to win the *"Best Product Award"* after designing a [product](https://catarinaburghi.xyz/blog/2021/03/31/stemathon) to help people from all ages with disabilities to go swimming safely!

I love learning about things I have no idea *exist* I'm always free to help out with any projects I could be useful for! 

And if you ever want to chat and don't know how to start a conversation with me just say *"How is this formula 1 season going?"* I promise I'll get to you as fast as I can ðŸ˜„
